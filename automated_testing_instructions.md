# Instructions
- Go to github and create your own repo for some App. in our case, we create cascabels-count-app
- Clone the repo to your directory
- Create a virtual environment using either conda or python3. To use python 3:
    `python3 -m venv <name of your environment>` and to activate this:
    `source <environment_name>/bin/activate`
- Start writing your code
- create a test file. This file must have the word `test` at the beginning of the name and every method to be tested must also begin  with test.

**starting a method with underscore or double underscore**: 
if you want to hide the method (not accessible after instantiation) then use double undescore. To hide a method but still make it accessible, use single underscore
